# DataVisualisation
Using Tableau, I have created a simple Spotify playlist dashboard to visualize popular artists, popular songs, and the years they were released and many other features. To create this dashboard, you can follow these steps:

    1.Obtain the dataset you wish to visualize from Kaggle or any other suitable source(I created a dataset on my own from the 
    Spotify Top 50 global songs playlist, including the required columns by using Ms.Excel)
    
    Note to considered:Clean the dataset(ie delete null values,identify missing values and outliers and remove them) to get 
    better visualization results.
    
    2.Import this dataset into Tableau.
    3.Create different sheets, with each containing various graphs and visualizations.
    4.Build a dashboard and integrate these sheets into it.
    5.Additionally, you can consider adding different extensions for radar charts, Sankey diagrams, and other visual elements 
    like navigation,webpages,images.

Note:
----
My Spotify dataset is also provided for reference purposes, feel free to use it
